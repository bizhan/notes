# The pursuit of Simplicity
## by Karolina Szczur

Achieve results quickly, doing more with less.

Don't be a **slave** of your tools.

### Frameworks

Is it necessary to use a framework?

Frameworks **are not** a substitute for thinking.

Drawbacks of using frameworks:
 - Unsemantic code (too much `div`s and `span`s)
   * Think about accessibility
 - Learning curve problem, you need time to familiarize with the framework
 - Overwrite VS. Override (lots of CSS gets overridden)
 - Heavyweight code

Pros:
 - Faster development
 - Testing made easy (peer review)
 - Community (StackOverflow, GitHub, etc.)
 - Begginer friendly

### Libraries

`document.querySelector` and **CSS animations** can **replace jQuery** in most
cases.

Use native HTML5 whenever possible.

### Pre processors

Hard to debug.

**Source Maps** to the rescue.

### How we can improve

Avoid the **hype** around libraries, frameworks and tools.

Beautiful =/= Usable

Simplicity =/= Minimalism

Don't overdo it!
